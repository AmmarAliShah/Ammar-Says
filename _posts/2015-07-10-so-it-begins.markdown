I'm growing tired of this! *This?* Writing this `Hello world` post. I'm writing it for the third time now and this time, I wanted
to change the title from my classic `Ello World`, and so I changed it to this - much better don't you think?

 <h3>Writing it for the third time?</h3>
 Yeah. I wrote the first one titled `Ello World` back when I started my blog in early 2015 but sadly, [I lost it!](https://medium.com/@ammarshah/how-i-lost-my-blog-24b31e300199). My first blog was based on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and hosted for free at [000WebHost](http://www.000webhost.com/690150.html). The problem with this setup was that it was ad-supported and on every refresh or load an ad popped up which was annoying!  

My second blog, sadly never made it to the internet. I set it up a few weeks ago, using [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) and it was hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). Now Ghost isn't natively supported on GitHub pages, as it only allows static sites and Ghost is based on [node.js](https://nodejs.org/). So, I found [this post](http://leftofnull.com/2014/02/07/using-github-pages-with-ghost-and-buster-on-windows-part-1/index.html), that used a set of tools to let you run Ghost on GitHub pages. Following the instructions, I successfully set up Ghost locally on my computer and configured it. That is when I wrote, this post for the second time, titled `Ello World...Again`. I ran into a problem with Buster with that setup and after numerous tries I couldn't fix it. I contacted the author of the post through Twitter, and I even commented on the post, but after a little back and fro, I gave up! I even got a Tweet from someone telling me the CSS on my site was broken - something I didn't notice. So I decided to try something else.

This brings us to my third and current state, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll, is built by [GitHub](https://github.com/), the same company whose service I was using to host my site so I thought you can't get more compatible than that, right? So I started with Jekyll and ran into problems with the final site again. So I explored other popular static site generators from the list at [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/). After trying out around a dozen other options and facing the same problem, I concluded I was doing something wrong. So I Googled around, and after a little playing around with Jekyll(actually a lot playing around), I finally nailed it!

<h3>So now what?</h3>
Now I plan on sticking with this for a while. I don't know for sure right now, but I will re-designt the site in the future, but right now, I don't have the time or the energy to do so.

<h3>Updates</h3>
+ I'm still working through [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/)
+ I started [Harvard CS50x](https://courses.edx.org/courses/HarvardX/CS50x3/2015/info) on edx
+ I gave learning Mandarin a try but I bailed out after just one day!
+ I got a haircut :-D

<h3>And?</h3>
And that's it. I plan on blogging regularly but I can't say for sure right now. My college starts from August and I'm gonna try to fit blogging into my routine. Till then, I'm working on a *non-profit* project atm(not from FreeCodeCamp) and I'll be writing about that in an upcoming post/posts.
