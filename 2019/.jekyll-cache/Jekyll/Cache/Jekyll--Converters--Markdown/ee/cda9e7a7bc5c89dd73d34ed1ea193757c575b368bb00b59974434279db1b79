<p>Today was Day 13 of my trip -  the final day!</p>

<p>I wasn’t able to post the last two days because my laptop messed up.</p>

<p>Here’s what happened:</p>

<h2 id="windows-10-messed-up">Windows 10 messed up!</h2>

<p>My system wouldn’t boot!</p>

<p>I sat down to write about my day but windows 10 wasn’t agreeing with me.</p>

<p>I tried again and again, but after an hour, I decided to go to bed and write in the morning.</p>

<p>In the morning, I tried again - no luck!</p>

<p>I got serious about fixing this problem and after trying everything I could, I did what I didn’t want to - I had to reset my windows.</p>

<p>Reset worked but I lost all of my apps which included Git and Jekyll, the two main <a href="/2015/07/10/so-it-begins/">things I need to run my blog</a>.</p>

<p>I had no time left to download and install everything again so I wasn’t able to post that day too!</p>

<p>I spent today travelling and got back home(Karachi) only a few hours ago.</p>

<p>I had to reset windows again then download everything.</p>

<p>It’s working fine now but I’ll have to look into this again.</p>

<p>So this is why this post went up so late.</p>

<p>Let’s begin with my last days now.</p>

<h2 id="day-11--12-exploring-abbottabad">Day 11 &amp; 12: Exploring Abbottabad</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/d11-13isl/02.jpg" alt="Abbottabad" /></p>

<p>Day 11 was the day I finally got time to explore Abbottabad.</p>

<p><a href="/2015/12/15/d2-abbott-isl/">Last time</a>, I didn’t get any time at all because I got there late and had to leave for <a href="/2015/12/16/d3-sheikhabad-isl/">Sheikh Abad</a> the next day.</p>

<p>So I actually spent Day 11 and some of Day 12 exploring Abbottabad.</p>

<p>On Day 12, at around 5 PM, we went to the <a href="http://www.daewoo.com.pk/terminal_view.asp?menu_set=5&amp;submenu_set=2&amp;page_title=Kakul&amp;terminal_code=45">Daewoo terminal in Kakul</a> to leave for Karachi.</p>

<p><em>Here are the few photos I took while exploring Abbottabad:</em></p>

<h2 id="day-13-daewoo">Day 13: Daewoo</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/daewoo.jpg" alt="Daewoo" /></p>

<p>Day 13 was entirely spent in the bus for Karachi.</p>

<p>Unlike [my experience with railway(/2015/12/14/d1-train-isl/), my experience with Daewoo wasn’t great.</p>

<p>We weren’t able to get tickets for anything else so we had no other choice then this.</p>

<p>The thing that made this experience really bad was the stops.</p>

<p>The bus took too many stops for too long.</p>

<p>They would announce a fifteen minute stop and stay for over an hour.</p>

<p>They took a little over 24 hours to get us from Rawalpindi to Karachi.</p>

<p>The service and the food was awful too.</p>

<p>They served us the same meal four times!!</p>

<p>A meal which consisted of a sandwich, a biscuit and two sweets!</p>
