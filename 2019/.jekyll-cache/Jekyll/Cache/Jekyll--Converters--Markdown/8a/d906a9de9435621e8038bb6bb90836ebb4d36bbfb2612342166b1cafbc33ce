<p>Iâ€™ve sent out tweets and wrote a blog post about it.</p>

<p>Yes Iâ€™m talking about going to Islamabad.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to leave in a few hours, but before I go, I thought I should share my bag pack with you.</p>

<p>Now this is not my only bag.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve got three more bags(!!).</p>

<p>This is my bag pack.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s get started now, shall we.</p>

<h2 id="the-bag">The Bag</h2>

<p><img src="" alt="" /></p>

<p>So first of all the bag itself:</p>

<p>The bag is a Camel Mountain laptop bag which I bought from a local market here about an year ago.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s in a <em>Grey-like color</em> though Iâ€™d prefer <em>Black</em> to match my heart(Just kidding!{or am I?})</p>

<p>What I really like about the bag is that itâ€™s really spacious and has just the right amount of padding so the back is soft and still strong enough to carry quite some weight.</p>

<p>The bag has served me well and Iâ€™m sure it will the next few years.</p>

<p>You can grab this bag for yourself from here</p>

<h2 id="whats-inside">Whatâ€™s inside</h2>

<p>Okay so now for the contents of the bag.</p>

<p>Normally I would stuff this blog with a lot and lot of stuff, but since I had to pack light for this trip, I only added things that I really needed.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a list of everything:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My HP 620 Notebook + Charger</li>
  <li>Laptop Cooler</li>
  <li>A notepad</li>
  <li><strong>The Forty Rules of Love</strong> by Elif Shafak (<em>The book Iâ€™m currently reading</em>)</li>
  <li>Sony Earphones</li>
  <li>USB to PS/2 convertor</li>
  <li>VGA Display Cable</li>
  <li>Mini Speakers</li>
  <li>USB Sticks &amp; SD Card Reader</li>
  <li>Mouse</li>
  <li>USB Port Extender</li>
  <li>Various Chargers for various devices</li>
</ul>

<p>The list may look long, but my bag is empty for the most part.</p>
