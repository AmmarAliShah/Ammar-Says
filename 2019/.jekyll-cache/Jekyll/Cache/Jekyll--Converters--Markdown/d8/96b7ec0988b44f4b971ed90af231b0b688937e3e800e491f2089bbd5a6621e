I"I<p>Today was Day 1 of my trip.</p>

<p>The day was almost completely spent in the train.</p>

<p>In a <a href="/2015/12/12/isl-trip/">previous post</a>, I wrote that I was really excited to finally travel in a train after almost ten years.</p>

<p>Well, I have to say I was rightly excited as the train ride was really fun though a bit long and tedious.</p>

<p>Well, first a shout-out to the Green Line Express team.</p>

<p>The service was great.</p>

<p>Our small little Train cabin had a TV, WiFi and blankets.</p>

<p>Though nothing was perfect(the WiFi didn’t work for 99% of the journey and the pillows were hard to sleep on), it still was a reasonably comfortable journey given that the train was very punctual.</p>

<p>I wasn’t able to <a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK">tweet</a> or <a href="https://www.periscope.tv/AmmarAliShahK">‘scope</a> from the train like I had planned to but oh well.</p>

<p>After an almost 22-hour train ride, I finally stepped out of the train ready to face the cold winter air of Rawalpindi.</p>

<p>My cousins house was in Islamabad and not in Rawalpindi and so we had to take a short ride in a car to get to their place.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, I was sitting with my cousins and family at their house in Islamabad.</p>

<p>Time to sleep now.</p>

<p>I need to rest to get ready for Day 2!</p>
