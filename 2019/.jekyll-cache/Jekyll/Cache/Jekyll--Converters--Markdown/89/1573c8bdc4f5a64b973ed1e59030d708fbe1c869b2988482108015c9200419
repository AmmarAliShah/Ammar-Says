I"E<p>Yes you read that correctly - an Android app by Microsoft.</p>

<p>The app is an alarm clock!</p>

<p>What’s special about this particular clock is that it does not just let you cancel your alarm - You have to play a game to turn it off!</p>

<p>The way it works is that when your alarm goes off, you are given two options you can swipe too - swipe left for snooze and swipe right to cancel.</p>

<p>If you swipe left, you get a five minutes snooze.</p>

<p>If you swipe right, you are presented with a small game - different every time.</p>

<p>Setting up an alarm is fairly simple and self explanatory.</p>

<p>I played around with a while and got quite interesting little things that would require me to either get out of bed, focus or turn on the light.</p>

<p>If you fail at the game, the alarm goes back to it’s previous state, that is the swipe part.</p>

<p>This is quite an interesting app as you <strong>can not</strong> turn the alarm off in your sleep.</p>

<p>This app is actually a part of Microsoft’s AI project, <a href="https://www.projectoxford.ai/">Project Oxford</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re someone who has trouble waking up, you might wanna try this app.</p>
