I"<p>Itâ€™s been 2 weeks since I took my <a href="e-learning/2015/07/25/leaving-cs50x/">JavaScript pledge</a> and itâ€™s Sunday night which means time for my weekly report. This week wasnâ€™t productive at all and I did even worse than <a href="/code/2015/08/02/js-pledge-week1/">last time</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I read Chapter 5 of Eloquent JavaScript</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I read Learn HTML &amp; CSS by Shay Howe</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I built a practice website(HTML &amp; CSS)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Solved the â€œreverse an arrayâ€ challenge</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thatâ€™s all I did this week. I hope Iâ€™ll do better next week!</p>
