<p>Today was Day 8 of my trip.</p>

<p>We went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havelian">Havelian</a>, to visit my cousin.</p>

<p>While my family sat in their house sipping tea and talking, I set out with my cousin to explore Havelian.</p>

<p>I took a walk around the place.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised as the small looking town is much larger than it seems.</p>

<p>It has itâ€™s own little Railway Station.</p>

<p>A relatively large bazaar too.</p>

<p>I wasnâ€™t able to take any pictures though!</p>

<p>After eating dinner, I returned to Abbottabad.</p>

<p>This was Day 8. Letâ€™s see where I go to tomorrow.</p>
