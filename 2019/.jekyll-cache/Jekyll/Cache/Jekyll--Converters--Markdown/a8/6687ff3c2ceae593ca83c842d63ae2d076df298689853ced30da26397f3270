I"g<p>Today was Day 2 of my trip.</p>

<p>I woke up to a very, very cold Islamabad morning.</p>

<p>Though I was really tired from <a href="/2015/12/14/d1-train-isl/">the long train ride</a>, I got up at 8 AM.</p>

<p>After breakfast we started to get ready to leave for Abbottabad.</p>

<p>That’s right! After travelling in a train for 22 hours, we were setting out once again for a 3-hour journey by car to Abbottabad.</p>

<p>We left around 2:30 PM and reached, a more colder Abbottabad around 6 PM.</p>

<p>During this over 3-hour ride, we stopped a few times to enjoy the view or just to grab a quick snack from the places we crossed.</p>

<p>The ride wasn’t as much fun as it was tiring so I didn’t really take many pictures.</p>

<p>I’m just glad to have reached Abbottabad safely.</p>

<p>Better sleep now since I have another adventure for Day 3 ahead!</p>
