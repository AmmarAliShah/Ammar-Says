I"š<p>I wasnâ€™t able to post the last few days because I didnâ€™t have my laptop with me.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to write about the four days I missed.</p>

<h2 id="day-04-to-06-wedding">Day 04 to 06: Wedding</h2>

<p>One of the main purposes of this trip was to attend my cousins wedding.</p>

<p>The wedding was a three day event.</p>

<p>The first and second day(Day 4 &amp; 5), was in Islamabad.</p>

<p>The third day(Day 6), was in Abbottabad.</p>

<p>It was really cold and I had to wear several articles of clothing.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t have much to say about it except that it was nice to hang out with the <strong>complete</strong> family.</p>

<h2 id="day-07-kenya">Day 07: Kenya</h2>

<p>On Day 7 I went to Kenya.</p>

<p>Kenya is a small village a little farther away from Mansehra.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s something I found out the <strong>hard way</strong>: <em>â€œItâ€™s a really really, really cold place.â€</em></p>

<p>Yes! That cold.</p>

<p>It was a short trip due to the cold.</p>

<p>I was shivering from the cold so  didnâ€™t take many pictures.</p>

<p><em>Here are the few photos I took:</em></p>
