I"’<p>Let me put it straight out: <strong>â€œI love to talkâ€</strong>.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s something I do all day, everyday. No really, ask my friends if you donâ€™t believe me. Most people might not think much of this but I admire <em>the art of talking</em> and also, the people who can do that really well.</p>

<p>People such as <em>Jesse Eisenberg</em>.</p>

<p>That guy is a true master in the art of speaking. I just love his fast-paced voiced( <strong>Although itâ€™s something he did get naturally but stillâ€¦</strong> ). Iâ€™ve spent countless hours imitating his words from <em>The Social Network</em> and <em>Now You See Me</em>.</p>

<p>There are people out there who donâ€™t really understand <strong>â€œThe Art of Speakingâ€</strong> and they probably never will. They might find it as something that the majority of the population can do. They may argue that this isnâ€™t a form of art or isnâ€™t really a skill, or itâ€™s not even a good thing  but I beg to defer!</p>

<p>Art is used to express oneself and there is no better way to express yourself than using your voice. For those who say that talking isnâ€™t a skill, Iâ€™d like to ask them that how many times have people listened with 100% attention while they talked. No one wants to hear people talk unless they have that magic in their voice.</p>

<p>I for one admire this art. If you ever find me somewhere and are thinking of a conversation topic, this is one. If you too are an admirer of this art, hit it in the comments and Iâ€™m very sure weâ€™ll get along very well. (If youâ€™re against this, I still wanna hear it so donâ€™t shy away)</p>
