<p>A few months ago, in August, I changed my smartphone and bought the <a href="http://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones/droid-maxx/m-droid-maxx.html">Motorola Droid Maxx</a>. Iâ€™ve been using the phone as my daily driver since and hadnâ€™t run into a problem with it though it was the 16-gig version and I had to do a bit of memory management but everything else was great. The great thing about this phone is that itâ€™s packed with a huge battery which is advertised to â€œ<em>last for up to 48 hours on a single charge</em>â€. Iâ€™m out a lot and this battery was just what I needed. Things wouldâ€™ve been percect if I had bought the 32-gig version but you donâ€™t get everything you wish for(and thatâ€™s okay).</p>

<p>The last few weeks, the battery started draining really fast - 7 - 10 hours / charge. The phone also started to heat up a but if used constantly. As busy as I am, I didnâ€™t put much thought into it until yesterday when I saw that it was really turning into a problem. A full charge(which would take up to 3 hours) was draining in just 7 hours! A little CPU intensive task would raise the temperature above 40Â°C!</p>

<p>A quick Google search and <strong>a lot</strong> of forum reading gave me a lot of information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I was not alone. A lot of other Droid Maxx owners were facing the same problem</li>
  <li>Most people started having this problem after they upgraded to Android 4.4 - my phone came with 4.4 pre-installed</li>
  <li><strong>The good news</strong> - Most people were able to fix the problem by doing simple things such as re-calibrating the battery, or formatting the phone or clearing the cache</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™ve decided to give the <em>factory reset</em> option a try. Iâ€™ll lose all my data in the process so Iâ€™m backing it all up to the cloud and my computer as I type this. Once itâ€™s done, Iâ€™ll factory reset the phone and clear the cache too. I hope thatâ€™ll fix the problem. If not, Iâ€™m going to try re-calibrating the battery. If all fails, Iâ€™ll be contacting support but hopefully it wonâ€™t come to that.</p>
