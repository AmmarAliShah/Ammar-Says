<p>Today is the end of my first year at Free Code Camp.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs take a look back:</p>

<h2 id="where-it-all-began">Where it all began</h2>

<p>One year ago today, I was going through my Facebook feed and saw a post by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ziakhan">Zia Khan</a>.</p>

<p>It was an article about <a href="http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2014/11/a-cautionary-tale-of-learning-to-code.html">the struggle of learning to code</a>.</p>

<p>As someone who had been learning to code since 2012, I was genuinely interested.</p>

<p>I began reading. It was written by <a href="https://twitter.com/ossia">Quincy Larson</a>.</p>

<p>Towards the end, there was a link to <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>.</p>

<p>I decided to sign up, because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It was free.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a complete full-stack track</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The founder was self-learned too</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hello-world">Hello World</h2>

<p><img src="/../assets/welcome-fcc.JPG" alt="Welcome to Free Code Camp" /></p>

<p>After signup I was presented with a small getting started video.</p>

<p>I was taken to a chat room where I was suppose to introduce myself.</p>

<p>I did the obvious and posted ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù.</p>

<p>Almost immediately I was welcomed.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs the thing that‚Äôs really different about Free Code Camp - <strong>The Community</strong>.</p>

<p>I still remember what was going on when I joined the chat.</p>

<p>I had interrupted a discussion on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto">Pluto</a> between <a href="https://twitter.com/iheartkode">Mark</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kodriscoll_dev">Kathy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanmalm">Ryan</a>.</p>

<p>Later on I found out that all three of them were on the volunteer team.</p>

<h2 id="team-fcc">Team FCC</h2>

<p><img src="/../assets/Ammar-fcc.png" alt="My bio on the team site" /></p>

<p>So I continued logging in everyday.</p>

<p>Completing challenges.</p>

<p>Talking to people in the chat.</p>

<p>More and more people joined and I followed suit and began welcoming new people.</p>

<p>I was addicted to the chat, to the people, to FCC.</p>

<p>I would be on the computer all day.</p>

<p>After a month, I knew every single person in the chat - I welcomed more than half of them.</p>

<p>New year came around, 2015.</p>

<p><strong>January 5th</strong>.</p>

<p>I got a private message from Quincy Larson.</p>

<p>He thanked me for helping out in the chat.</p>

<p>I was really happy.</p>

<p>He then asked me if I wanted to join the team.</p>

<p>I said yes.</p>

<p>We had a brief Skype session.</p>

<p>He added me to a private ‚ÄúCamp Counselors‚Äù room.</p>

<p>He introduced me.</p>

<p>It was official - I was on team FCC.</p>

<h2 id="a-year-later">A year later</h2>

<p><img src="/../assets/today - fcc.JPG" alt="Free Code Camp homepage 2015" /></p>

<p>Fast forward a year, and here we are.</p>

<p>A lot has happened in the last 11 months.</p>

<p>Free Code Camp has grown to 150k+ campers.</p>

<p>The courses have changed completely.</p>

<p>FCC has enabled people to get jobs.</p>

<p>Basically, FCC is no longer the, small group of people chatting and learning to code, that it used to be.</p>

<p><strong>A lot has change and a lot hasn‚Äôt.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The community is still great.</li>
  <li>When you join, along with people, a bot welcomes you!(That‚Äôs 2015 for ya!)</li>
  <li>Free Code Camp is still free and will remain so.</li>
  <li>Free Code Camp is still <a href="https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp">Open-Source</a></li>
  <li>Rather than a team of fixed people, FCC now has many people contributing to the community through GitHub.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>To sum it up, Free Code Camp has been a great experience.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve managed to learn more in the year at Free Code Camp than I had managed to learn in two years on my own.</p>

<p>Free Code Camp is where it is today, because of the hard work of great people like <a href="https://twitter.com/ossia">Quincy</a>,  <a href="https://twitter.com/BerkeleyTrue">Berkeley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/terakilobyte">Nathan</a>.</p>

<p>I suggest Free Code Camp to almost everyone who wants to learn to code.</p>

<p><em>Why?</em></p>
