I"Å<p>So I recently <a href="/e-learning/2015/07/25/leaving-cs50x.html">quit CS50x</a> and in that post I stated I‚Äôd be writing about my progress every week till the end of the year. Well it‚Äôs Sunday and my time is up and as stated, this is y first weekly report. This week wasn‚Äôt as productive as I thought it would be due to some family events. I had to spend three complete days away from my house and computer(Wednesday, Friday and Sunday) so that put me a little behind on my progress.</p>
