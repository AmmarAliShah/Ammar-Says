<p>If you follow me on Twitter, <em>which you probably don‚Äôt</em>, but if you do, you must have spotted something I tweeted out a few days ago:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s final - I&#39;m going to Islamabad in a week ‚ò∫‚ò∫</p>&mdash; Ammar Ali Shah (@AmmarAliShahK) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK/status/672624888742551552">December 4, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôm going to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad">Islamabad</a> on Sunday(Dec 14) i.e Tomorrow Night!!!</p>

<p>It‚Äôll be roughly around a two weeks trip and I‚Äôll be back in Karachi before the end of the year(hopefully).</p>

<p>The main reason for the journey is to attend my cousin‚Äôs weeding who is FINALLY getting married next week.</p>

<p><em>Congratulations to him! :))</em></p>

<p>I‚Äôm really excited to go because I get to travel in a train for the journey and I haven‚Äôt been on a train since about 10 or 12 years!</p>

<p>On the other hand, I‚Äôm a bit scared that I won‚Äôt be able to bear the cold.</p>

<p>Oh well!</p>

<p>I guess I‚Äôll find out!</p>

<h2 id="join-me">Join me!</h2>
