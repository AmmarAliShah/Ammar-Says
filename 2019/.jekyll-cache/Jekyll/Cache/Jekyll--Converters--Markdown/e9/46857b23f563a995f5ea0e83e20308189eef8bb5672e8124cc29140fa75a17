I"æ<p>The last couple of months have been so busy with teaching 5 hours a day, Gym, PokÃ©mon Go, client work(Iâ€™m a freelance developer), learning to drive and most recently school, that Iâ€™ve hardly had time to use social media.</p>

<p><em>Iâ€™ve Tweeted about 10 times in the past 2 weeks.</em></p>

<p><em>I last changed my Facebook display in 2014</em> (Also my picture anywhere else online)</p>

<p><em>My last Instagram post was around 12 weeks ago</em></p>

<p>The list goes on and onâ€¦</p>

<p>The point is, Iâ€™ve been more or less a ghost on social media for the last few months. I used to be really active on sites like Quora and Instagram but over time I havenâ€™t been able to keep up and Iâ€™m not happy about that.</p>

<p>So, Iâ€™ve taken on a little mission:  <strong>Mission â€˜More Socialâ€™</strong></p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to slowly try to be more active on social media sites. Iâ€™m going to start with the big three i.e. Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus(Yes!) and then move on to others like Instagram, Quora, Tumblr and the rest. This, though, <strong>does not</strong> mean that all of a sudden Iâ€™ll be very active on all my social accounts. Iâ€™m going to slowly use them a little more and then find out which socials I need and which I donâ€™t, and then Iâ€™ll be active on the ones I need/like.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s the plan for now!</p>
