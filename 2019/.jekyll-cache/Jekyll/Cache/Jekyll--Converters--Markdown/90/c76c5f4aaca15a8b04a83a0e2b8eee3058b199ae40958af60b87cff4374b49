<p>Look at the calendar.</p>

<p>Look at the clock.</p>

<p><strong>It’s 2016!</strong></p>

<p>2015 is behind us and now 2016 is where we stand.</p>

<p>The page has turned and has given us yet another year to improve our lives and the lives of others around us.</p>

<p>If you have nothing else to be grateful for, just be grateful that you have been given the chance to live another day.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look back on 2015:</p>

<p>For me, <em>2015 was the year of change.</em></p>

<p>Now you may say that, <strong>“Ammar, that’s every year”</strong> but just hang on for a second.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at what I’m talking about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I joined the Free Code Camp team! An amazing experience. I got to work remotely as a team with people from all over the globe. Working on something I actually believe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I got into Open-Source development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/2015/07/10/so-it-begins/">I started this blog</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I started and <a href="/2015/07/25/leaving-cs50x//">left CS50x</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I got done with my CIEs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I switched schools.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I joined <a href="https://www.zidisha.org/">Zidisha</a>, yet another non-profit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/2015/10/25/ammar-says/">I named this blog</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/2015/12/01/year-at-fcc/">I completed a year at Free Code Camp</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/2015/12/12/isl-trip/">I travelled in a train and I went on a Winter Trip and blogged about it, turning this blog into a travel blog</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AND, <a href="http://ammaralishah.github.io/archive/">I wrote <strong>22</strong> blog posts</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I could write a lot more changes but these are the main ones that mean something to me.</p>

<p>It’s been an amazing year and I’ve done so much. :))</p>

<p>## 2016?</p>

<p>Well that was my 2015.</p>

<p>Let’s hope 2016 brings even more exciting things in life, <em>because if life isn’t exciting, what is it?</em></p>

<p>Happy New Year to you all and I hope it is an exciting year for you all!</p>
