<p>Mobile phones have come a long way -  from clunky old devices to pocket computers. With every new release, they only get bigger and better - <em>better cameras, better screens, better operating systems, etc</em>. Phone manufacturers seem to be improving smartphones in every aspect except for one - “<strong>The Battery</strong>”.</p>

<p>There are few phones out there with <em>good battery life</em> - The <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_droid_maxx-5604.php">Motorola Droid Maxx</a> is one of those few, although <a href="/2015/10/24/droid-maxx-battery/">I’ve been facing a problem with its battery</a>. Here’s the thing phone manufacturers don’t get: <strong>What good is a device with a kickass screen and a great camera but which only has six hours of battery?</strong> If I were to go review most of the the newly released phones, I’d point out one similarity between all of them - <em>the battery sucks</em>!</p>

<p>So this blog post is for phone manufacturers, listen up ya’ll:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We love everything you’re doing with our smartphones - Give us speed, give us better screens, give us better cameras but for Gods sake, GIVE US BETTER BATTERIES!!!</p>
