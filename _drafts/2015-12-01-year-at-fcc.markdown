Today is the end of my first year at Free Code Camp.

Let's take a look back:

## Where it all began

One year ago today, I was going through my Facebook feed and saw a post by [Zia Khan](https://www.facebook.com/ziakhan).

It was an article about [the struggle of learning to code](http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2014/11/a-cautionary-tale-of-learning-to-code.html).

As someone who had been learning to code since 2012, I was genuinely interested.

I began reading. It was written by [Quincy Larson](https://twitter.com/ossia).

Towards the end, there was a link to [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com).
